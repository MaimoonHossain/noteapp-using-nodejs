# NoteApp
Created an app that allows us to perform crud on some notes that interacts with a file and takes advantage of some of the core modules like fs.


Used other packages like jest, yargs and open. Created some tests to test some of the things and lastly created a simple but sophisticated Web server that sends back some server-side HTML that gets interpolated from data from our database.
